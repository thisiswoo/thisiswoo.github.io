  summary: >
    Java & Spring 기반의 2년 차 백엔드 개발자 이건우입니다. 주로 웹 개발/배포/운영을 하고 있습니다.
    항상 꾸준함을 유지하기 위해 저만의 루틴을 실천 중이며, 소중히 배운 것들을 기록하기 위해 Gitgub과 기술 블로그를 운영하고 있습니다.<br><br>

    회사 개발 문화에 관심이 많아 일주일에 한 번 **스터디 모임**을 **추진**하여 진행하며, 이를 통한 새로운 지식들을 **기술 블로그**에 **기록**하고 있습니다.<br>
    또한, 실무에서 개발 이슈 발생시 **문제의 원인**과 **테스트**를 통해 **문제 파악**과 해결해 나가는 재미에 푹 빠져있습니다.
