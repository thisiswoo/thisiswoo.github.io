## Hello, World!

Hi, I'm **GeonWoo Lee**, *a.k.a.* **thisiswoo**.<br>
I'm currently working at **[Xiness]**.<br>
I started a blog to document what I saw, felt and learned.<br>
In addition to what I learned, I will also record my hobbies and daily life on my blog.<br>
Pleaseh check my [resume] if you wish to know more about me.

<!-- 
Thank you for buying the PRO version of Hydejack! ðŸŽ‰

More than one year ago I was looking for a blogging platform but couldn't find it:
One that would let me write posts in markdown with my own editor,
one that didn't look awful buy modern design standards, and one that felt snappy on a mobile phone.
That and more is now Hydejack. I hope you enjoy it [as much as I do](https://qwtel.com/).

## First Steps
Start by reading the [Documentation]{:.heading.flip-title}.
Specifically, the chapters below should be relevant now:

* [Install]{:.heading.flip-title} --- How to install and run Hydejack.
* [Config]{:.heading.flip-title} --- Once Jekyll is running you can start with basic configuration.

containing example content:
